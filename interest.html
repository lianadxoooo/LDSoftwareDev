        <p>My interests outside of studying include of reading books such as classical novels like Pride and Prejudice or thrillers such as The Silent Patient. I also enjoy watching a variety of movies during my spare time. My favourite animals are Dachshunds. My favourite colours are baby pink and lilac.</p>


        

        <p>I also enjoy learning about cybersecurity in my spare time as I find it fascinating to read about ethical hacking, online threats and how security can be built into code and networks. </p>
